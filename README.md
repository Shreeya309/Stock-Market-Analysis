# Stock-Market-Analysis
Overview
The Stock Market Dashboard is a clean, user-friendly Streamlit web application focused on visual stock market analysis and company information display. The platform has been simplified from its original ML-focused architecture to provide clear, graphical presentation of stock data with interactive charts and comprehensive company search functionality. Built with a streamlined interface, the application offers real-time data fetching via the Yahoo Finance API and beautiful visualizations through Plotly candlestick charts.

User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language. Focus: Clean visual presentation of company stock values in graphical format without complex ML features. Company Selection: Expanded comprehensive list covering multiple sectors for better search functionality.
